Below is an outline of what I think would be useful to help me learn.
As I learn more, I imagine I will change this. At some point in the 
future, I should come back and look at what I did.

1. Make some changes
2. Add and commit them
3. Back Track


## Collaboration
The big thing that I want to get out of this is to be able to fork,
change, merge, pull and all that jazz that I don't yet understand.
After that, it's about being able to teach that to other people.
